# fitness-tracker
A Fitness Tracker exercise that can save Exercise as packages so user don't have to select all exercises again and again. It also have a streak system to keep track of user's consistency. (Made with the help AI)

# Features
[1] Streak System - Saves the date and exercises submitted by user to local storage to keep track, compares the last date saves with today's date. If last date == yesterday's date then increases a day in streak else sets streak to 1.

[2] Package System - Gives user to save exercises they do daily as one package to save time. User can save exercises as packages by selecting the exercises and reps/timing they do daily then click "Save as package", it will ask to set a name, name it anything you like as it will show the same name in the "Load Packages:" dropdown menu.

[3] Screenshot System - Once user has submitted the exercises it provides a screenshottable tab which can be used to keep a personal track or to show your streak to friend and family members!

That's all the website have for now, i used help of AI to do the streak system as I didnt know how to save data (dates) to local storage and then also compare it to today's date.
